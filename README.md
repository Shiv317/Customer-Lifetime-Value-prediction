Customer Lifetime Value Prediction
Project Overview
The Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction project aims to predict the future value a customer will bring to a business based on their historical interactions. Using key metrics like Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values, along with other important features, this project utilizes machine learning regression techniques to estimate CLV.

This prediction helps businesses target high-value customers and make strategic decisions related to marketing and customer retention.

Key Features:
Feature Engineering: Calculate Recency, Frequency, Monetary, AOV, Customer Tenure, and other metrics.
Regression Modeling: Apply machine learning regression to predict customer lifetime value.
Model Evaluation: Use Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared to evaluate model performance. 
Tech Stack:
Programming Language: Python
Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
Evaluation: Mean Squared Error, R-squared
